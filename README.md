# Computing Full Conformal Prediction Set with Approximate Homotopy.

This package implements a computation of conformal prediction set based on approximate solution of empirical risk minimization when the input observations changes sequentially. We develop a new homotopy continuation technique so that only a finite number of computation are needed to approximate infinitely many solution on a given interval [ymin, ymax].

## Installation & Requirements

This package has the following requirements:

- [numpy](http://numpy.org)
- [scipy](http://scipy.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org)
- [python-intervals](https://pypi.org/project/python-intervals/)

We recommend to install or update anaconda to the latest version and use Python 3.
